# GameOfUr
This is my android app adaptation of The Royal Game of Ur (humanities oldest board game!). It is stil
a work-in-progress. Currently online multiplayer still needs to be implemented, the temporary graphical assets need to be replaced with
better (read: not made by me) ones, and the code needs to be cleaned up a bit.

Please pardon our mess.
